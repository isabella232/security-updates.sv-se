Introduction to Deploying Windows Server Update Services 3.0
============================================================

This guide describes how to deploy Microsoft® Windows® Server Update Services (WSUS) 3.0. Begin your WSUS deployment by reading about how WSUS functions, its general requirements, and its features for scalability and bandwidth management. Read how to choose a network and database configuration for your WSUS 3.0 installation in [Design the WSUS 3.0 Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/45aa4ae3-31c8-4a0b-a472-c665052b2d37). Next, read how to install and configure the WSUS server in the section [Install the WSUS 3.0 Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/71ff9545-c2dd-4825-8aae-b442bbd07daa). Then read how to configure Automatic Updates on client workstations and servers that will be updated by WSUS in [Update and Configure the Automatic Updates Client](https://technet.microsoft.com/f02af94a-8a7b-49fc-9973-b576b942c5b9).
