Cannot access the WSUS console
==============================

If you get an error when using or trying to access the WSUS console, use the following information to troubleshoot the problem.

Grant users permissions for WSUS console access
-----------------------------------------------

If users do not have appropriate permissions for the WSUS console, they receive an "access denied" message when trying to access the WSUS console. You must be a member of the Administrators group or the WSUS Administrators group on the server on which WSUS is installed in order to use the WSUS console.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If WSUS is installed on a domain controller, only a member of the Domain Administrator group can use the WSUS console. |

**To add a user to the WSUS Administrators group**
1.  On the WSUS server, click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Computer Management**.

2.  In **Computer Management**, expand **Local Users and Groups**, click **Groups**, and then double-click **WSUS Administrators**.

3.  In the **WSUS Administrators Properties** dialog box, click **Add**.

4.  In the **Enter the object names to select (examples)** box, type the object name, and then click **OK**.

You cannot access the WSUS console with an IP address when WSUS is configured to use a proxy server
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have WSUS configured to use a proxy server, then you cannot access the WSUS console by using an IP address. To work around this issue, use a domain name to access the WSUS server, for example, for the user name, type: *DomainName\\user name* for the user name, when prompted to log in on the WSUS console.

Cannot access the WSUS console and a timeout error message appears
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you cannot access the WSUS console and a timeout error message appears, the CPU of the WSUS server may be at, or very close to, maximum utilization, causing the database to time out. If the database software times out, the WSUS console cannot be displayed.

One way of inadvertently overtaxing your WSUS server is to have antivirus software installed on it, which is monitoring the WSUS content directory. During synchronization, the antivirus software can overload out the CPU. You can work around this situation by setting the antivirus software to ignore where WSUS content is stored.

Cannot access the WSUS console on a Windows 2000 server after applying the hisec server.inf security template
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue applies only to Windows 2000 servers. If you cannot access the WSUS administrative console after applying the hisec server.inf security template, you need to relax security permissions for ASP.NET and IWAM local machine accounts in order for the WSUS console to function.

The workaround is to give read access for IWAM and ASP.NET accounts to the following registry key.

**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\software\\microsoft\\update services**

**To give read access for the IWAM account on Windows 2000 Server configured as a domain controller**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type **regedit.exe** and then click **OK**.

3.  In Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE \\Software\\Microsoft\\Update Services**

4.  Point to **Edit**, and then click **Permissions**.

5.  In the **Permissions for Microsoft Windows Server Update Services** properties dialog box, click **Add**.

6.  In the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups** box, click **Locations**.

7.  In the **Locations** dialog box, select the local computer, and then click **OK**.

8.  In the **Select Users, Computers, or Groups box**, type *computer\_name***\\ASPNET** and *computer\_name***\\IWAM\_***computer\_name* in the **Enter the object name to select (examples)** box. Use a semicolon to separate names. For example, type *computer\_name***\\ASPNET;***computer\_name***\\IWAM\_***computer\_name*

    where *computer\_name* is the name of the computer.

9.  Select *computer\_name***\\ASPNET**, and click the **Read** box in the **Allow** column.

10. Select *computer\_name***\\IWAM\_***computer\_name*, and click the **Read** box in the **Allow** column, and then click **OK**.

Promoting the WSUS server to a domain controller might disrupt your ability to access the WSUS console
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you promote a WSUS server to a domain controller and then try to access the WSUS console, you might receive a message similar to the following:

`Server Error in '/' Application. `

`Access to the path "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\Temporary ASP.NET Files\wsusadmin\8c91a6b5\649b28ba\global.asax.xml" is denied. `

This occurs if IIS 6.0 and ASP.NET are installed on the server before the server is promoted to a domain controller. This is because the Network Service group does not have sufficient permissions for the Temporary ASP.NET Files folder. To avoid this problem, make sure that you promote the WSUS server to a domain controller before you install IIS 6.0 and ASP.NET. To resolve this issue, enable appropriate permissions for the Network Service group by using the following procedure.

**To enable appropriate permissions for the Network Service group**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run.**

2.  In the **Open** box, type **cmd**, and then click **OK**.

3.  At the command prompt, type the following, and then press ENTER:

    *drive:***\\windows\\microsoft .net\\framework\\v1.1.4322\\aspnet\_regiis -i**

    where *drive* is the drive letter of the disk on which you installed Windows.

Cannot access the WSUS console on Windows 2000 Server configured as a domain controller
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you cannot access the WSUS administrative console and you are using Windows 2000 Server configured as a domain controller, you need to relax security permissions for ASP.NET in order for the WSUS console to function. The workaround is to give read access for IWAM account to *%windir%*\\assembly.

**To give read access for the IWAM account on Windows 2000 Server configured as a domain controller**
-   At the command prompt, type the following, and then press ENTER:

    **cacls** *%windir%***\\assembly /e /t /p IWAM\_***xxxx***:R**

    where *%windir%* is the Windows directory of the computer and where IWAM\_*xxxx* is the IWAM computer account.
