Update Automatic Updates
========================

WSUS requires that clients use a version of Automatic Updates compatible with WSUS.

You must update your WSUS clients' version of Automatic Updates by using the client self-update feature.

If you have been using Software Update Services (SUS) to distribute updates, some WSUS clients may be using the SUS client, while others may be using the WSUS client. The new WSUS client will replace the old SUS client, but both versions will be able to contact a SUS server. If you point the WSUS client to a SUS server, the WSUS client will function like the older SUS client, complete with the old user interface. If you used SUS to deploy Windows XP with SP2, you cannot see the new Automatic Updates user interface, and none of the new WSUS client functionality is available.

Automatic Updates Client Self-Update Feature
--------------------------------------------

With the advent of the original client software for SUS, each time Automatic Updates checks the public Web site or internal server for updates, it also checks for updates to itself. This means that most versions of Automatic Updates can be pointed to the public Windows Update site and they will automatically self-update. You can also use the WSUS server to self-update the client software. For specifics, see the "Client Self-Update" section in [Install and Configure IIS](https://technet.microsoft.com/6b2e1035-5b82-45f4-9f51-6cc0ca32fd60) earlier in this guide.

The self-updating client software is available on the following operating systems:

-   Windows 2000 with Service Pack 3 or Service Pack 4
-   Windows XP with Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2
-   Windows Server 2003

#### Updating Automatic Updates in Windows XP with No Service Packs

Windows XP with no service packs has Automatic Updates installed, but it will not automatically update itself when pointed to the WSUS server. If you have Windows XP without any service packs in your environment, and have never used SUS, you must install the SUS client software to enable Automatic Updates to self-update. After you load the SUS client, you can point these clients to the server running WSUS. If the client self-update feature is configured on port 80 of the WSUS server, the SUS client will find the WSUS client software and self-update. For more information about the client self-update feature, see "Client Self-Update," in [Install and Configure IIS](https://technet.microsoft.com/6b2e1035-5b82-45f4-9f51-6cc0ca32fd60) earlier in this guide.
