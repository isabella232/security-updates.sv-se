Installation of Required Software
=================================

The following is a list of required software for the Windows Server operating systems that support WSUS 3.0.

If any updates require restarting the computer when installation is completed, restart your server before installing WSUS.

For a complete list of system requirements, refer to the Release Notes for Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2.
