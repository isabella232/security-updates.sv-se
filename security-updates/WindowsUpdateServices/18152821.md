Step 4: Configure and Synchronize WSUS
======================================

After installing WSUS, you are ready to access the WSUS console and synchronize WSUS.

You must synchronize WSUS before you attempt to migrate content.

By default, WSUS is configured to use Microsoft Update as the location to obtain updates. If you have a proxy server on your network, use the WSUS console to configure WSUS to use the proxy server.

After you configure the network connection, you can obtain updates. Consider using the WSUS synchronization option for deferred downloads, which is enabled by default. Also, configure WSUS to download updates for the same number of languages that SUS was configured to download updates. By default, WSUS is configured to download all languages. These configurations ensure that you do not unnecessarily download updates already on your network or in languages that you do not require.

To get updates, you must *synchronize* the WSUS server. Synchronization involves the WSUS server contacting Microsoft Update. After making contact, WSUS determines if any new updates have been made available since the last time you synchronized. Because this is the first time you are synchronizing the WSUS server, all of the updates are available and are ready for your approval for installation.

| If approvals are created on the WSUS server before approval migration is performed, the explicitly created approvals are overwritten by the migration of approvals. |

Step 4 contains the following procedures:

-   Open the WSUS console.
-   Configure proxy-server settings so that WSUS can obtain updates.
-   Configure WSUS language settings.
-   Synchronize your WSUS server.

**To open the WSUS console**
-   On your WSUS server, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Microsoft Windows Server Update Services**.

| You must be a member of either the WSUS Administrators or the local Administrators security groups on the server on which WSUS is installed in order to use the WSUS console. If you do not add http://*WSUSWebsiteName* to the list of sites in the Local Intranet zone in Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, you might be prompted for credentials each time you open the WSUS console. If you change the port assignment in IIS after you install WSUS, you need to manually update the shortcut on the **Start** menu. You can also open the WSUS console from Internet Explorer on any server or computer on your network at the following URL: http://*WSUSServerName*:\[*port*\]/WSUSAdmin |

**To specify a proxy server**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  In the **Proxy server** box, select the **Use a proxy server when synchronizing** check box, and then type the proxy server name and port number (port 80 by default) in the corresponding boxes.

3.  If you want to connect to the proxy server by using specific user credentials, select the **Use user credentials to connect to the proxy server** check box, and then type the user name, domain, and password of the user in the corresponding boxes. If you want to enable basic authentication for the user connecting to the proxy server, select the **Allow basic authentication (password in clear text)** check box.

4.  Under **Tasks**, click **Save settings**, and then click **OK** in the confirmation dialog box.

**To specify WSUS language options (optional)**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**, then read the warning and click **OK**.

3.  In the **Advanced Synchronization Options** dialog box, under **Languages**, select one of the following language options, and then click **OK**.

    -   **Download only those updates that match the locale of this server (Locale)** where *Locale* is the name of the server locale. This means that only updates targeted to the locale of the server will be downloaded during synchronization.
    -   **Download updates in all languages, including new languages** This means that all languages will be downloaded during synchronization. If a new language is added, it will be automatically downloaded.
    -   **Download updates only in the selected languages** This means that only updates targeted to the languages you select will be downloaded during synchronization. If you choose this option, you must also choose each language you want from the list of those available.

**To synchronize your WSUS server**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Tasks**, click **Synchronize now**.
