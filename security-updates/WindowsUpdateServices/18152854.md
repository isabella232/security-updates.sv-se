Reports in Windows Server Update Services 3.0
=============================================

Reports are an important part of managing WSUS. You can keep track of nearly every aspect of the WSUS network by means of reports. The most important kinds of reports are:

-   Summary compliance reports (the number of computers that need to install updates and the number of updates missing from computers).You can generate these reports from the root node of the WSUS administration console.
-   Individual computer reports. You can generate these reports by right-clicking the computer in the **Details** pane.
-   Individual update reports. You can generate these reports by right-clicking the update in the **Details** pane.
-   Downstream server summary compliance reports. You can generate these reports by right-clicking the server in the **Details** pane.
-   Synchronization reports. You can generate these reports by right-clicking the synchronization in the **Details** pane.
