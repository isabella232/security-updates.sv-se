Setup Issues
============

If you are having trouble installing WSUS, use the following information to troubleshoot the problem.

Check for required software and hardware
----------------------------------------

WSUS has a number of requirements that need to be met prior to installation. For more information, see [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777).

In some cases, setup might fail if you choose the WMSDE database
----------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, when you choose the WMSDE database, Setup tries to repair WMSDE and falls into an infinite loop. This is a known issue with the RC release of WSUS. Use [this Knowledge Base article](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=48007) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48007 to recover from this problem and install WSUS by using WMSDE.

If the Server service is not running when you install WSUS, the WSUS installation fails
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you select WMSDE for your database software and the Server service is not running on the computer where you intend to install WSUS, the WSUS installation fails. This is because WMSDE requires the Server service to be running to install, and if WMSDE fails to be installed, the WSUS installation fails.

To work around this issue, turn on the Server service, and run WSUS Setup again. Use the Knowledge Base article [You cannot install MSDE 2000 if the Server service is not running](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=48009) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48009 to recover from this problem and install WSUS by using WMSDE.

You cannot install MSDE 2000 if the Server service is not running.
