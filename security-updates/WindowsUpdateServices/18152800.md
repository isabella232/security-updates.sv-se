Run WSUS Server Setup
=====================

After reviewing the previous topics, you are ready to install WSUS. You must log on with an account that is a member of the local Administrators group. Only members of the local Administrators group can install WSUS.

If you want to do an unattended installation, see [Appendix A: Unattended Installation](https://technet.microsoft.com/3e8fcb38-d5a9-4285-baa2-23323a384cb1) later in this guide.

| The latest version of WSUSSetup.exe is available on the [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=47374) for Windows Server Update Services at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=47374. |

**To install WSUS on your server**
1.  Double-click the installer file (WSUSSetup.exe).

2.  On the **Welcome** page, click **Next**.

3.  Read the terms of the license agreement carefully, click **I accept the terms of the License Agreement**, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select Update Source** page, you can specify where client computers get updates. If you select **Store updates locally**, updates are stored on WSUS and you can select a location in the file system to store updates. If you do not store updates locally, client computers connect to Microsoft Update to get approved updates.

    Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

    For more information, see [Determine Where to Store Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/3102c059-d7a4-49d8-8de8-299e730bb109) earlier in this guide.

5.  On the **Database Options** page, you select the software used to manage the WSUS database. By default, WSUS offers to install WMSDE to computers running Windows Server 2003. You can specify where WSUS installs WMSDE. To accept the default setting, click **Install SQL Server desktop engine (Windows) on this computer**. If you cannot use WMSDE, click **Use an existing database server on this computer**, and select the instance name from the drop-down list.

    Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

    For more information, see [Choose the Database Used for WSUS](https://technet.microsoft.com/86b1e90d-307d-4b35-88a1-84baccd1ff63) earlier in this guide.

6.  On the **Web Site Selection** page, you specify the Web site that WSUS will use. Note two important URLS: the URL to point client computers to WSUS and the URL for the WSUS console where you configure WSUS.

    Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

    For more information, see [Install and Configure IIS](https://technet.microsoft.com/6b2e1035-5b82-45f4-9f51-6cc0ca32fd60) earlier in this guide.

7.  On the **Mirror Update Settings** page, you specify the management role for this WSUS server. If you want a central management topology, enter the name of the upstream WSUS server. If this is the first WSUS server on your network or you want a distributed management topology, skip this screen.

    Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

    For more information about management roles, see [Choose a Management Style](https://technet.microsoft.com/c18ab8e3-b76d-46a8-84e6-b46adb778098) earlier in this guide.

8.  On the **Ready to Install Windows Server Update Services** page, click **Next**.

9.  If the final page of the wizard confirms that the WSUS installation was successfully completed, click **Finish**.

To complete the setup, the root of the drive where WSUS stores updates must have certain permissions for WSUS to function. WSUS setup does not modify permissions on the root drive where you store updates, but this drive may not have appropriate permissions set. For example, security tools may have been used to strip away default permissions from the disk prior to the installation of WSUS. To manage this problem, use the following procedure to check the drive where updates are stored to ensure permission are set correctly.

**To check permissions on the drive where updates are stored**
1.  Double click **My Computer**, and then right-click the drive where updates are stored and select **Sharing and Security**.

2.  Ensure that the drive has read permissions for the **NT Authority\\Network Service** group on Windows Server 2003. For Windows 2000 Server, the drive should have read permissions for the **Users** group. If the drive does not have these permissions, you must add them.

For a comprehensive list of all permissions required by WSUS, see the topic "Verifying WSUS Server Settings" in the Troubleshooting Windows Server Update Services in the Operations Guide. The latest version of this document is available on the [Microsoft Windows Server 2003 TechCenter site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171) for Windows Server Update Services at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=41171.
