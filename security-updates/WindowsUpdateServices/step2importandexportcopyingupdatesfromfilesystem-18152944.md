Step 2 Import and Export: Copying Updates from File System
==========================================================

Copy updates from the file system of the export server to the file system of the import server. These procedures use the Windows Backup or Restore Wizard, but you can use any utility you like. The object is to copy updates from the file system on the export server to the files system of the import server.

| The initial settings for access control lists differ between Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003. If you are copying content from Windows 2000 Server to Windows Server 2003, you have to manually add the Network Service group to the access control list for the folder where updates are stored. Give the Network Service group Full Control. |

**To back up updates from file system of export server to a file**
1.  On your export WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **ntbackup**. The Backup or Restore Wizard starts by default, unless it is disabled. You can use this wizard or click the link to work in **Advanced Mode** and use the following steps.

3.  Click the **Backup** tab, and then specify the folder where updates are stored on the export server. By default, WSUS stores updates at *WSUSInstallationDrive*:\\WSUS\\WSUSContent\\.

4.  In **Backup media or file name**, type a path and file name for the backup (.bkf) file.

5.  Click **Start Backup**. The **Backup Job Information** dialog box appears.

6.  Click **Advanced**. Under **Backup Type**, click **Incremental**.

7.  From the **Backup Job Information** dialog box, click **Start Backup** to start the backup operation.

8.  Move the backup file you just created to the import server.

**To restore updates from a file to the file system of the import server**
1.  On your import WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **ntbackup**. The Backup or Restore Wizard starts by default, unless it is disabled. You can use this wizard or click the link to work in **Advanced Mode** and use the following steps.

3.  Click the **Restore and Manage Media** tab, and select the backup file you created on the export server. If the file does not appear, right-click **File**, and then click **Catalog File** to add the location of the file.

4.  In **Restore files to**, click **Alternate location**. This option preserves the folder structure of the updates; all folders and subfolders will appear in the folder you designate. You must maintain the directory structure for all folders under \\WSUSContent.

5.  Under **Alternate location**, specify the folder where updates are stored on the import server. By default, WSUS stores updates at *WSUSInstallationDrive*:\\WSUS\\WSUSContent\\. Updates must appear in the folder on the import server designated to hold updates; this is typically done during installation.

6.  Click **Start Restore**. When the **Confirm Restore** dialog box appears, click **OK** to start the restore operation.
