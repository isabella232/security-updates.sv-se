Backup and restore issues
=========================

If you cannot access WSUS data after restoring the database, check the WSUS server name and user permissions for the database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you restore a WSUS database but cannot access the restored from the WSUS console check for the following:

-   If you have changed the WSUS server name since the backup, you must add the corresponding users to the database to enable the WSUS console to access the data.
-   If you restore the backup to a WSUS server other than the one from which you backed up the database, you will have the same result and must also add the corresponding users.
-   In either case, the users need to be granted permissions for public and Web service.
