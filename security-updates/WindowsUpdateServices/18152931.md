Create a Replica Group
======================

A description of the benefits of creating a replica group is available in "Centralized Management," in [Choose a Management Style](https://technet.microsoft.com/c18ab8e3-b76d-46a8-84e6-b46adb778098) earlier in this guide.

**To create a replica group for centralized management of multiple WSUS servers**
1.  Install WSUS on a computer at a site where it can be managed by an administrator. Follow the steps in [Run WSUS Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/63c82e0c-f8b0-451d-b32b-2275385920df) earlier in this guide.

2.  Install WSUS on a computer at a remote site. Follow the steps in [Run WSUS Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/63c82e0c-f8b0-451d-b32b-2275385920df) earlier in this guide. When you get to the **Mirror Update Settings** page during WSUS setup, enter the name of the WSUS server from step 1.

3.  Repeat step 2 as necessary to add additional WSUS servers to the replica group.
