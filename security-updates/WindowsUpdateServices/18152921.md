Upgrade Issues
==============

When an upgrade fails, WSUS might be uninstalled
------------------------------------------------

Depending on at what point an upgrade fails, you might lose your previous WSUS settings and data. Therefore, before attempting an upgrade, back up the following:

-   WSUS database
-   Update file storage folder

For information about backing up and restoring your existing WSUS installation, see [Backing Up Windows Server Update Services](https://technet.microsoft.com/c0f1a661-eb48-4156-81a2-267d846f844f).
