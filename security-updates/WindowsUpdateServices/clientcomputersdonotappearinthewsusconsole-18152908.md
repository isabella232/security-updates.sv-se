Client computers do not appear in the WSUS console
==================================================

If you are having problems with client computers not appearing on the **Computers** page in WSUS console, use the following sections to troubleshoot the problem.

Problem with client self-update
-------------------------------

If you cannot get clients to appear on the **Computers** page in the WSUS console, it is almost always a problem with client self-update, which is the mechanism that WSUS uses to update the SUS client to the WSUS client (Automatic Updates) software. For more information about client-self update, see [Automatic Updates Must Be Updated](https://technet.microsoft.com/b23562a8-1a97-45c0-833e-084cd463d037).
