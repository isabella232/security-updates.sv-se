Introduction to Deploying Windows Server Update Services
========================================================

This guide describes how to deploy Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). Begin your WSUS deployment by reading about how WSUS functions, its general requirements, and its features for scalability and bandwidth management. First, read [Design the WSUS Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/2877be79-b5d6-483c-8eb6-045afe96c7d2). Next, read how to install and configure the WSUS server in the section, [Install the WSUS Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/9d55bda5-9eb9-46d2-a204-62034936eb13).Then read how to configure Automatic Updates on client workstations and servers that will be updated by WSUS in [Update and Configure the Automatic Updates Client Component](https://technet.microsoft.com/08ede2e2-efa8-4e49-80b9-0fe20bcda2a7).

There are companion papers to this guide that offer other types of information about WSUS. For an overview of WSUS features, read "Microsoft Windows Server Update Services Overview." For information about administering WSUS or troubleshooting problems with WSUS, read "Windows Server Update Services Operations Guide." The latest versions of these documents are available on the [Tech Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171) site for Windows Server Update Services at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171.
