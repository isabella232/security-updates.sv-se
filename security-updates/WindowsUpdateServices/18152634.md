Step 3 Import and Export: Copying Metadata from Database
========================================================

Export update metadata from the database on the export server, and import it into the database on the import server. The WSUS Setup program copies WSUSutil.exe to the file system of the WSUS server during installation. You must be a member of the local Administrators group on the WSUS server to export or import metadata; both operations can only be run from the WSUS server itself.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Never import exported data from a source that you do not trust. Importing content from a source you do not trust might compromise the security of your WSUS server. |

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| During the import or export process, the Update Service, the Windows NT service that underpins the WSUS application, is shut down. |

**To export metadata from the database of the export server**
1.  At the command prompt on the export server, navigate to the folder that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe export** *packagename logfile*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe export export.cab export.log**

    That is, WSUSutil.exe followed by the export command, the name of an export .cab file, a space, and the name of a log file.

    The package (.cab file) and log file name must be unique. WSUSutil.exe creates these two files as it exports metadata from the WSUS database.

3.  Move the export package you just created to the import server.

**To import metadata to the database of the import server**
1.  At the command prompt on the import server, navigate to the directory that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe import** *packagename logfile*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe import export.cab import.log**

    That is, WSUSutil.exe followed by the import command, the name of export .cab file created during the export operation, a space, and the name of a log file.

    WSUSutil.exe imports the metadata from the export server and creates a log file of the operation.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| It can take from 3 to 4 hours for the database to validate content that has just been imported. Please be patient. |
