Step 3: Install WSUS on Your SUS Server
=======================================

After reviewing the installation requirements and optionally installing MSDE, you are ready to install WSUS. The following procedure uses the default WSUS installation options for Windows 2000 Server with SUS installed. This requires you to supply database software, store updates locally, and use the custom Web site on port 8530. If you are using Windows Server 2003, you do not have to supply database software. Although some illustrations may look slightly different from screens in Windows Server 2003, the steps are very similar. Any procedural differences are called out in the text of this guide.

You must log on to the server you plan to install WSUS on by using an account that is a member of the local Administrators group. Only members of the local Administrators group can install WSUS.

**To install WSUS on Windows 2000 Server with SUS**
1.  Double-click the installer file **WSUSSetup.exe**.

    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | The latest version of WSUSSetup.exe is available on the [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=47374) for Windows Server Update Services at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=47374. |

2.  On the **Welcome** page of the wizard, click **Next**.

3.  Read the terms of the license agreement carefully, click **I accept the terms of the License Agreement**, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select Update Source** page, you can specify where clients get updates. If you select the **Store updates locally** check box, updates are stored on the WSUS server and you select a location in the file system to store updates. If you do not store updates locally, client computers connect to Microsoft Update to get approved updates.

    Keep the default options, and click **Next**.

5.  On the **Database Options** page, do one of the following depending on the operating system you are using:

    -   For Windows Server 2003, click **Install SQL Server desktop engine (Windows) on this computer**.
    -   For Windows 2000 Server, click **Use an existing database server on this computer**, select the instance name from the **SQL instance name** box, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Web Site Selection** page, click **Create a Microsoft Windows Server Update Services Web site**.

    This page also lists two important URLs based on this selection: the URL to which you will point WSUS client computers to get updates, and the URL for the WSUS console where you will configure WSUS.

7.  On the **Mirror Update Settings** page, you can specify the management role for this WSUS server. If this is the first WSUS server on your network or you want a distributed management topology, skip this screen.

    If you want a central management topology, and this is not the first WSUS server on your network, select the check box, and type the name of an additional WSUS server in the **Server name** box. For more information about management roles, see the “Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services” white paper.

    Keep the default option, and click **Next**.
