Running Reports
===============

Reports enable you to monitor the components of your Windows Server Update Services implementation.

Using the Reports Page
----------------------

You can generate three main reports from the **Reports** page, as described in the following table, and in the sections that follow.

#### Status of Updates Report
  
The Status of Updates report enables you to view the status for all of your approved updates. You can view the report in three ways: you can view the status of an update at a high level, by computer group, and by computer.
  
The report displays information resulting from the most recent contact between client computers and the WSUS server. The frequency with which client computers contact the WSUS server is configured through Group Policy. By default, this is every 22 hours. Unless you want to change the contact frequency for your client computers, generate this report the day after you approve updates, so that it reflects your latest approvals. For more information about configuring Group Policy, see [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Updates Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777).
  
| ![](images/Cc708481.note(WS.10).gif)Obs!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| You can use a command-line tool on client computers that are running the WSUS client software (Automatic Updates) in order to initiate contact between the client computer and WSUS server. This can be useful if you want to get immediate update status for a particular computer—you can run this tool to force connection and then generate a Status of Updates report. |
  
**To initiate immediate contact between a client computer and WSUS server**  
-   On the client computer, at the command prompt, type **wuauclt.exe /detectnow**, and then press **ENTER**.
  
**To run a Status of Updates report**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**.
  
2.  On the **Reports** page, click **Status of Updates**.
  
#### Update summary view
  
The update summary view is the default view that appears when you run a Status of Updates report. By default, the report displays an alphabetical list of approved updates.
  
You can filter the display by both approval action and computer group by making appropriate selections under **View** and then clicking **Apply**. Your filter is reset to the default list of all updates when you close the Status of Updates report.
  
The columns displayed in the update summary view are described in the following table.

You can also print the report, including the list of individual updates with status for individual computers, if you have expanded the computers (clicked the + symbol). However, you cannot print the dialog box that appears when you click individual updates in the list or when you click the status for an individual update.
  
**To run a status report for computers**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**, and then click **Status of Computers**.
  
2.  Under **View**, select the criteria you want to use to filter the report, and then click **Apply**. The report displays a cumulative update status summary for all of the computers in the computer group and for the status you specified.
  
3.  If you want more information about a specific computer, you can do the following:
  
    -   To view the status of individual updates for the computer, expand the computer (click the + sign next to the computer). In addition, you can see the properties of an individual update by clicking the title of the update.

**To run a Synchronization Results report**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**.
  
2.  On the **Reports** page, click **Synchronization Results**. By default, the report displays synchronization results for the last 30 days.
  
3.  To change the synchronization period for the report, under **View**, select another synchronization period in the list, and then click **Apply**.
  
4.  To print the report, under **Tasks**, click **Print report**.
  
| ![](images/Cc708481.note(WS.10).gif)Obs!                                                                   |

In addition, you can get more information about a specific update by clicking the update title.  
-   The update compliance status report summarizes information for a specific update, including the update properties, and status for each computer group. You can run this report from the **Updates** page as described in the following procedure; however, this report is also available on every update property dialog box.
  
**To run a computer compliance status report**
