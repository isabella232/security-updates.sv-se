Issues with WSUS 3.0 Services
=============================

WSUS uses seven services. They are the Update Service (wsusservice.exe), the Reporting Web Service, the API Remoting Web Service, the Client Web Service, the Simple Web Authentication Web Service, the Server Synchronization Service, and the DSS Authentication Web Service. This section explains how to troubleshoot these services in general.

Troubleshooting services
------------------------

#### General service troubleshooting

You can use the following steps to restart services that are not functioning properly:

1.  Locate the service (click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, click **Services**, and then look for the service).
2.  Verify that the service is running. Click **Start** if it is stopped or **Restart** to refresh the service.

You can also use the Event Viewer to check the Application, Security, and System event logs to see if there are any events that indicate a problem. You should also check the SoftwareDistribution.log to see if there are events that indicate a problem.

#### Reset IIS

You should reset IIS if you suspect that there are problems with Web services.

1.  Open a command window.
2.  Type **iisreset**

#### SQL service

The SQL service must be running for all the services except the self-update service. If any of the log files indicate SQL connection problems, check the SQL service first. To access the SQL service, click the **Start** button, point to **Administrative Tools**, click **Services**, and then look for one of the following:

-   **MSSQLSERVER** (if you are using Windows Internal Database, or if you are using SQL Server and are using the default instance name for the instance name).
-   **MSSQL$WSUS** (if you are using a SQL Server database and have named your database instance "WSUS").

Right-click the service, and then click **Start** if the service is not running or **Restart** to refresh the service if it is running.

#### Access rights on Web service directories

Incorrectly set permissions on Web service directories can cause problems for WSUS Web services. WSUS setup will create these directories and set the access rights correctly, but subsequent developments, such as the installation of different applications or the operation of security software, may have reduced the permissions. See [Appendix D: Permissions on WSUS Directories and Registry Keys](https://technet.microsoft.com/0eeba30a-390a-4891-8c73-71605c4152f4) for more information about the different Web service directories and the correct access rights for them.

#### IIS settings for Web services

IIS must be configured correctly for WSUS Web services. WSUS setup will configure its Web services correctly, but the subsequent addition of new Web services or reconfiguration of the default Web site (if the default site is used by WSUS) may cause the configuration to change. See [Appendix C: IIS Settings for Web Services](https://technet.microsoft.com/b940c212-f4c4-493f-906a-29bcdc7c9186) for an explanation of how to check IIS configuration, as well as the correct settings on each of the Web services and for the WWW web service.
