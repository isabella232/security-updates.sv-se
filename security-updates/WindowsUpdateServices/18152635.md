Remote Server Migration
=======================

The remote server migration procedure is a four-step process, with an optional step for testing. If you intend to utilize a computer without a SUS installation to deploy WSUS, use this process.

Remote server migration is helpful if you were using multiple SUS servers to approve content for different types of client computers. This scenario features the ability to map migrated SUS approvals and updates to computer groups on the WSUS server, as depicted in the following illustration.

Step 1 Remote Server Migration: Install and Configure WSUS
----------------------------------------------------------

Unlike same-server migration, you do not have to concern yourself with installing WSUS in any special way. You must, however, synchronize the WSUS server prior to migrating. Consider using the synchronization option for deferred downloads, which is enabled by default. Also, configure WSUS to download updates for the same number of languages SUS was configured to download updates. By default, WSUS is configured to download all languages. These configurations ensure that you do not unnecessarily download updates already on your network or in languages that you do not require.

**Install and configure WSUS on a computer separate from SUS**
-   Install and configure WSUS on a computer that does not have SUS installed. For more information, see [Run WSUS Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/63c82e0c-f8b0-451d-b32b-2275385920df) and [Configure Advanced Synchronization Options](https://technet.microsoft.com/75060d37-429c-4cf8-a5ee-708470794b7c) earlier in this guide.

Step 2 Remote Server Migration: Migrate Content and Approvals
-------------------------------------------------------------

Remote server migration requires that you share the Content folder on each SUS server you want to migrate to the WSUS server (or use the default share to access the content folder).

You do have to make sure that SUS is not synchronizing before you migrate content or approvals. You do not have to migrate both content and approvals from the remote SUS server. You can opt to initially migrate content and then migrate approvals at another time, or any number of combinations that suit your purpose.

Use WSUSutil.exe to migrate content and approvals from SUS to WSUS. For more information about WSUSutil.exe, see [Migration Command-line Tool](https://technet.microsoft.com/c06eceaf-a4f6-4b74-a694-75960fdf706b) earlier in this guide.

If you intend to map SUS approvals to a WSUS computer group, first create the group on WSUS. For step-by-step instruction, see [Create Computer Groups for Computers](https://technet.microsoft.com/07c6fa5b-7588-43f2-a495-45df16a2958a) earlier in this guide.

**To share remote content on SUS for migration to WSUS**
1.  On the SUS computer, locate the SUS content store in the file system. By default, SUS content is stored in C:\\SUS\\Content\\.

2.  Right-click the **Content** folder, and then click **Sharing and Security** (or **Sharing**, on computers running Windows 2000).

3.  In the **Properties** dialog box for the Content folder, click **Share this folder**.

4.  Click the **Security** tab, and ensure that the **Everyone** group has **Read** NTFS permissions for the Content folder.

5.  Click **OK**.

6.  Repeat this step on each SUS server you intend to migrate.

**To migrate remote content and approvals from SUS and map approvals to a custom computer group on WSUS**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *LocationOfRemoteSUSContent* **/approvals** *SUSServerName* **"***WSUSTargetGroupName***" /log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content \\\\sus1\\content\\cabs /approvals sus1 "all desktops" /log remote\_migration.log**

**To migrate local content and approvals from SUS and map approvals to the All Computers target group in WSUS**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the **following**:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *LocationOfRemoteSUSContent* **/approvals** *SUSServerName* **/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content \\\\sus1\\content\\cabs /approvals sus1 /log remote\_migration.log**

**To migrate only remote content**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *LocationOfRemoteSUSContent* **/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content \\\\sus1\\content\\cabs /approvals sus1 /log remote\_migration.log**

**To migrate only remote approvals**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains WSUSutil.exe

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /approvals** *SUSServerName* **/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /approvals sus1 /log remote\_migration.log**

Step 3 Remote Server Migration: Test WSUS (Optional)
----------------------------------------------------

Any computer that is going to connect to WSUS must have the WSUS client. When you installed WSUS, the client self-update feature was set up automatically by the WSUS installer.

**To deploy the WSUS client software for testing**
-   Deploy the WSUS client in your environment to test WSUS (optional). See [Update Automatic Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/4de6a129-fbf1-41ef-b255-5510554713c5) earlier in this guide for instruction.

Step 4 Remote Server Migration: Point SUS Clients to WSUS
---------------------------------------------------------

Point the SUS clients to WSUS. As the SUS clients check in with the WSUS server, they will find the WSUS Web site and self-update to the WSUS client.

**To point SUS clients to WSUS**
-   Use Group Policy or registry settings to point SUS clients to WSUS. See [Determine a Method to Configure Automatic Updates Clients](https://technet.microsoft.com/8b786951-a481-49a6-a0e6-69189e58f2ab) earlier in this guide for instruction.
