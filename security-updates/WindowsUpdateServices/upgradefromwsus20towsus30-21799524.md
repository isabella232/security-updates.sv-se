Upgrade from WSUS 2.0 to WSUS 3.0
=================================

The WSUS 3.0 installation program will upgrade all WSUS 2.0 settings to WSUS 3.0. Furthermore, if the installation program finds any SQL Server database other than SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2 or SQL Server 2008, it will back up the existing database, install Windows® Internal Database, and migrate the database to it. For more information on databases, see [Choose the Database Used for WSUS 3.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/3e47f0a7-b25d-4b84-a6be-0c96b505af9d)

Before upgrading from WSUS 2.0 to WSUS 3.0
------------------------------------------

You should make sure that your WSUS 2.0 installation is in good working order before upgrading.

1.  Check for recent errors in the event logs, problems with synchronization between downstream servers and upstream servers, or problems with clients not reporting. Make sure that these issues have been resolved before continuing.
2.  You may want to run DBCC CHECKDB to ensure that the WSUS database is correctly indexed. For more information about CHECKDB, see [DBCC CHECKDB](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=86948) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=86948).
3.  Back up the WSUS database.

Upgrading a Remote SQL Server Installation from WSUS 2.0 to WSUS 3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have installed WSUS 2.0 on one computer and the SQL Server database on another, you must uninstall WSUS 2.0 from the database server before upgrading to WSUS 3.0.

**To upgrade WSUS 2.0 to WSUS 3.0 with a remote SQL Server installation**
1.  Uninstall WSUS 2.0 from the back-end computer. Do not choose to delete the database.

2.  Install WSUS 3.0 on the front-end computer.

The WSUS Operations Guide, available at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139838](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139838), includes other types of migration documentation, such as migrating from Windows Internal Database to Microsoft SQL Server.

After upgrading
---------------

It is a good idea to reindex the database after you upgrade. For more information about reindexing the database, see [Appendix I: Database Maintenance](https://technet.microsoft.com/e787794b-4f09-4d01-ae4e-5983ea7634f9) in the WSUS Operations Guide.
