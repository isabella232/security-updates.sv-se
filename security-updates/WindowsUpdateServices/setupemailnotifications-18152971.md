Set Up E-Mail Notifications
===========================

The WSUS 3.0 server can be configured to send e-mail notifications of new updates and reports on the status of the WSUS network. Notifications will be sent whenever the WSUS server synchronizes new updates, and status reports can be sent daily or weekly. E-mail notifications do not include rolled-up computer status from replica downstream servers.

**Set up e-mail notifications**
1.  In the WSUS Administration console, click **Options** in the left pane.

2.  In the center pane, click **E-Mail Notifications**.

3.  Click the **General** tab.

4.  If you want update notifications, select the **Send e-mail notification when new updates are synchronized** check box.

5.  In the **Recipients** box, type the e-mail addresses of the people who should receive update notifications. Separate the names with semi-colons.

6.  If you want status reports, select the **Send status reports** check box.

7.  In the **Frequency** box, select either **Daily** or **Weekly**.

8.  In the **Send reports at** box, set the time at which you want status reports to be sent.

9.  In the **Recipients** box type the e-mail addresses of the people who should receive status reports, delimited by semicolons.

10. In the **Language** box, select the language in which the status reports should be sent.

11. Click **Apply** to save these settings.

| If both the WSUS administrative console and the WSUS server have the same settings for Daylight Savings Time adjustments, notifications will appear at the correct time. If the adjustments for Daylight Savings Time are different, then notifications will be off by the difference in the Daylight Savings Time adjustment. |

**Set up the e-mail server**
1.  Click the **E-Mail Server** tab.

2.  In the **Outgoing e-mail server (SMTP)** box, type the name of your SMTP server.

3.  In the **Port number** box, type the server's SMTP port (25 by default).

4.  In the **Sender name** box, type the sender's e-mail display name. Generally this will be the name of the WSUS administrator.

5.  In the **E-mail address** box, type the sender's e-mail address.

6.  If the SMTP server requires logon information, select the **My SMTP server requires authentication** check box.

7.  Enter the user name and password in the respective boxes.

    | You can change authentication credentials only on a WSUS server, not from a remote administration console. |

8.  Click **Apply** to save this information.

9.  After saving the e-mail server information, test your configuration by clicking **Test**. The Event Viewer will show any issues related to sending the e-mail.

10. If your e-mail notification is not working properly, one place to look is the SoftwareDistribution.log file (found in your WSUS directory, usually …\\Program Files\\Update Services\\LogFiles). One error message that is symptomatic of an incorrect SMTP configuration is the following:

    `EmailNotificationAgent.WakeUpWorkerThreadProc Exception occurred when sending email of type Summary: System.Net.Mail.SmtpException: Failure sending mail. ---> System.IO.IOException: Unable to read data from the transport connection: net_io_connectionclosed`.

    Investigate your SMTP e-mail server configuration to resolve this problem.
