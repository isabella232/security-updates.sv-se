Viewing Updates
===============

On the **Updates** page, you can do the following:

-   View the list of updates. The list of updates displays updates that have been synchronized from the update source to your server running Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and are available for approval. You can filter the list of updates by using criteria such as classifications and products, approval status, synchronization date, and text string. In addition, you can sort the list of updates by clicking the appropriate column heading in the list of updates title bar
-   View details, status, and revision history for each update.
-   Approve updates for installation.
-   Approve updates for detection.
-   Decline updates.

**To open the Updates page**
-   On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Updates**.

**To view updates**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Updates**. Updates are displayed in the list of updates.

    -   The **Status** tab displays download, approval, and installation status for the update by computer group. You can further expand computer groups to see update status by computer.
