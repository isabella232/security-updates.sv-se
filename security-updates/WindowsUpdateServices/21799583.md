Issues with Backup and Restore
==============================

Use the information in this section to troubleshoot issues around backing up and restoring WSUS.

Troubleshooting backup and restore issues
-----------------------------------------

#### Cannot access WSUS data after restoring the database

If you restore a WSUS database but cannot access it from the WSUS administration console, check for the following:

-   If you have changed the WSUS server name since the backup, you must add the server to the WSUS administration console.
-   If you restore the backup to a WSUS server other than the one from which you backed up the database, you must add the server to the WSUS administration console.
-   Verify that your user permissions are still valid for the database.

#### Clients have download failures after restoring the database

If you are storing content locally, and the metadata in the database does not match the update files in the content directory, clients could suffer download failures when attempting to install an update listed in the database but not found in the content directory. You can resolve this problem, or prevent it from occurring, by making sure to run **wsusutil reset** after every restore procedure. For details, see the "wsusutil reset" section in [Managing WSUS 3.0 from the Command Line](https://technet.microsoft.com/4d4b90e9-bbb2-429a-92c9-1e5388240416).
