Design the WSUS 3.0 Deployment
==============================

The first step in deploying WSUS 3.0 is to design the server configuration. The following sections describe various aspects of deployment design—from a simple configuration with a single server to a configuration with multiple WSUS servers. Some of the considerations to take into account are connection bandwidth (for both Internet connections and LAN or WAN connections), network configuration, and different language requirements.
