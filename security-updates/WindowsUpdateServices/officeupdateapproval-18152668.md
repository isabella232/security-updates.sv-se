Office Update Approval
======================

If you use WSUS to update Microsoft Office on your network computers, consider the following:

-   You must use an original baseline source for Microsoft Office Administrative Install Points (AIP) to use WSUS to update Office XP and Office 2003 on client computers. If you are applying updates to the AIP, you cannot use WSUS. The two methods of applying updates are mutually exclusive. If you have applied an update to an AIP and want to roll back the AIP to an original baseline source, use the instructions found at the [Microsoft Support Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=63962) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=63962.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Administrative Install Points are relevant only to Office XP and Office 2003. They are not used with Office 2007. |

-   If you have purchased a "per user" license agreement for Office or have installed Office per user, WSUS will not update Office.
-   Users can access the public Microsoft Office Online Web site to look for updates to their Office installation through the Microsoft Office Update wizard. Using Group Policy, you might want to create policies that prevent users from getting their own Office updates from Microsoft Office Online.
