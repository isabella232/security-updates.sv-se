Issues with High CPU Utilization
================================

Clients may notice very high (approaching 100 percent) CPU utilization for a few minutes, especially after rebooting. The symptoms have been reported for clients running Microsoft Office 2003. There is an update for this issue described by [FIX: When you run Windows Update to scan for updates that use Windows Installer, including Office updates, CPU utilization may reach 100 percent for prolonged periods](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=80817) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=80817).
