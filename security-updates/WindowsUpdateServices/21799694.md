Migrating from Windows Internal Database to SQL Server
======================================================

This topic explains how to migrate the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) database from a Windows Internal Database instance (installed by default during WSUS setup) to a full version of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2.

Why Migrate the WSUS Database to SQL Server
-------------------------------------------

If you chose to use Windows Internal Database as the WSUS database when you set up your WSUS server, you may want to upgrade the database engine to a full installation of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2. SQL Server lets you administer the WSUS database through the SQL Server Management Studio.

SQL Server Database Requirements
--------------------------------

-   WSUS requires SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2. If you use the full version of SQL Server, the database administrator should first verify that the nested triggers option is turned on before setting up the WSUS database.
-   You cannot use SQL authentication. WSUS supports Windows authentication only.

Scenarios
---------

The topic presents the following scenarios:

-   Migrating the Windows Internal Database database to an instance of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 that is running on the WSUS server
-   Migrating the Windows Internal Database database to an instance of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 that is running on another server (remote SQL)

Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require you to reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be resolved. Modify the registry at your own risk. Before you edit the registry, export the keys in the registry that you plan to edit, or back up the whole registry. If a problem occurs, you can then restore the registry to its previous state.

### Migrating the WSUS Database

Use the following steps to migrate the WSUS database from a Windows Internal Database instance to an instance of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2.

**To migrate the WSUS database**
1.  Install SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 with the **Server and Client Tools** option on your WSUS server.

2.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.

3.  Right-click **IIS Admin Service**, and then click **Stop**.

4.  Right-click **Update Services**, and then click **Stop**.

5.  Run the following SQL command to detach the WSUS database (SUSDB) from the Windows Internal Database instance, by using the **sqlcmd** utility. For more information about the **sqlcmd** utility, see [sqlcmd Utility](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81183) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81183).

    
        ```
6.  In SQL Server Management Studio, under the instance node, right-click **Databases**, select **Properties**, and then click **Attach**.

7.  In this step, you will verify that NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE has login permissions to the instance of SQL Server and to the WSUS database. If it does not, you will have to add it to both locations. This account should also be a member of the webService role on the WSUS database.

    -   To verify permissions on the instance of SQL Server, in SQL Server Management Studio, open the instance and select **Security**, and then **Logins**. The NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE account should be listed as a login. If it is not, it should be added.
    -   To verify permissions on the database, right-click the database, select **Properties** and then click **Permissions**. The NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE account should be listed as a login. If it is not, it should be added.
    -   To verify members of the webService role, under the WSUS database, select Roles, right-click webService, and then select Properties. The NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE account should be listed as a member of this role. If it is not, it should be added.

8.  In the **Attach Databases** box, under **Databases to attach**, locate the susdb.mdf file (by default, this is **C:\\WSUS\\UpdateServicesDbFiles** if you installed Windows Internal Database), and then click **OK**.

9.  In this step, you will edit the registry to both point WSUS to the instance of SQL server that now holds the WSUS database and recognize the new database for future WSUS updates. If you have not already done this, export the keys in the registry that you plan to edit, or back up the whole registry.

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
    2.  Find the following key: **HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\UpdateServices\\Server\\Setup\\SqlServerName**, and in the **Value** box, type **\[ServerName\]\\\[InstanceName\]**, and then click **OK**. If the instance name is the default instance, type **\[ServerName\].**
    3.  Find the following key: **HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Update Services\\Server\\Setup\\wYukonInstalled**. In the **Value** box, type **0**, and then click **OK**.

10. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.

11. Right-click **IIS Admin Service**, and then click **Start**.

12. Right-click **Update Services**, and then click **Start**.

13. Verify that the database migration was successful by opening the WSUS administrative console. (Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Microsoft Windows Server Update Services 3.0**.)

### Migrating the WSUS Database and Moving to a Remote SQL Server

The goal of this scenario is to take the WSUS database running in a Windows Internal Database instance on the WSUS server and move and upgrade it to an instance of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 that is running on a remote server. Only a full SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 database may be used in a remote SQL installation. Each step, where appropriate, indicates the server on which you perform the procedure.

#### Remote SQL Scenario Limitations

-   You cannot use a server configured as a domain controller for either the front end or the back end of the remote SQL server pair.
-   You cannot use a server that is running as a Terminal Services server for the front end of the remote SQL server pair.
-   You cannot use Windows Internal Database for database software on the back-end server.
-   Both the front-end and the back-end servers must be joined to an Active Directory directory service domain.

#### Prerequisites

Front end server starting configuration:

-   Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 or Windows Server 2008 operating system
-   WSUS with Windows Internal Database

Back end server starting configuration:

-   Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 or Windows Server 2008 operating system
-   SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2

##### To migrate the WSUS database from a Windows Internal Database instance to an instance of SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 on a remote server

1.  On the front end server: Install Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2005 SP2 with the **Server and Client Tools** option. This step will enable you to use the SQL Server Enterprise Manager on the front end server.
2.  On the front end server:
    1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.
    2.  Right-click **IIS Admin Service**, and then click **Stop**.
    3.  Right-click **Update Services**, and then click **Stop**.
3.  On the front end server: Run the following SQL command to detach the WSUS database by using the **sqlcmd** utility. For more information about the **sqlcmd** utility, see [sqlcmd Utility](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81183) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81183).
    
        ```
5.  On the back end server:
    1.  To attach **SUSDB** to the destination instance of SQL server, under the instance node, right-click **Databases**, select **Properties**, and then click **Attach**.
    2.  In the **Attach Databases** box, under **Databases to attach**, locate the susdb.mdf file (by default this is **C:\\WSUS\\UpdateServicesDbFiles** if you installed Windows Internal Database), and then click **OK**.
6.  On the back end server:
    -   To verify permissions on the instance of SQL Server, in SQL Server Management Studio, open the instance ,select **Security**, and then **Logins**. The front end server machine account should be listed as a login. If it is not, it should be added.
    -   To verify permissions on the database, right-click the database, select **Properties**, and then click **Permissions**. The front end server machine account should be listed as a login. If the server account is not listed, it should be added.
    -   To verify members of the webService role, under the WSUS database, select **Roles**, right-click **webService**, and then select **Properties**. The front end server machine account should be listed as a member of this role. If the server account is not listed, it should be added.
7.  On the front end server: In this step, you will edit the registry to point WSUS to the destination instance of SQL and to recognize the new database for future WSUS updates. If you have not already done so, export the keys in the registry that you plan to edit, or back up the whole registry.
    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.
    2.  Find the following key: **HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\UpdateServices\\Server\\Setup\\SqlServerName**. In the **Value** data box, type **\[BEName\]\\\[InstanceName\]**, and then click **OK**. If the instance name is the default instance, type **\[BEName\]**.

        <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
        <td style="border:1px solid black;">When typing [BEName], do not add the domain name before the name.
        </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
 

    3.  Find the following key: **HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Update Services\\Server\\Setup\\wYukonInstalled**. In the **Value** box, type **0**, and then click **OK**. This indicates that Windows Internal Database is not used.
    4.  Find the following key: **HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\UpdateServices\\Server\\Setup\\SqlInstanceIsRemote**. In the **Value** box, change the value to **1**, and then click **OK**.
8.  On the front end server:
    1.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.
    2.  Right-click **IIS Admin Service**, and then click **Start**.
    3.  Right-click **Update Services**, and then click **Start**.
9.  On the front end server: Verify that the database migration was successful by opening the WSUS administrative console. (Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Microsoft Windows Server Update Services 3.0**).
