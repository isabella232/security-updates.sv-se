Introduction to Deploying Windows Server Update Services 3.0
============================================================

This guide describes how to deploy Microsoft® Windows® Server Update Services (WSUS) 3.0. Begin your WSUS deployment by reading about how WSUS functions, its general requirements, and its features for scalability and bandwidth management. Read how to choose a network and database configuration for your WSUS 3.0 installation in [Design the WSUS 3.0 Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/31b20259-1b32-4316-959e-84b478705cc6). Next, read how to install and configure the WSUS server in the section [Install the WSUS 3.0 Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/2cd2d2ac-47e8-461f-99bd-db6bd3af1dfc). Then read how to configure Automatic Updates on client workstations and servers that will be updated by WSUS in [Update and Configure the Automatic Updates Client](https://technet.microsoft.com/d3d56210-9f71-49b7-b0d1-a04fb52d4e53).
