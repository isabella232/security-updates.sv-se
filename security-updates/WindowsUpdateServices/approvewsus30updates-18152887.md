Approve WSUS 3.0 Updates
========================

You should approve updates to test the functionality of your WSUS deployment. There are many options for deploying updates; the procedure below covers only the basics. Use WSUS Help or the [Microsoft Windows Update Services 3.0 Operations Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81072) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81072 to understand all your approval options.

**To approve multiple updates for installation**
1.  On the WSUS Administration console, click **Updates**, and then click **All Updates** or the classification of updates you wish to approve.

2.  On the list of updates, right-click the update or updates you want to approve for installation, and then click **Approve** on the shortcuts menu.

3.  In the **Approve Updates** dialog box, click the arrow next to the computer group for which you wish to approve the updates, and then click **Approved for Install**.

4.  If you want to approve these updates for subgroups of this group, click the arrow again, and then click **Apply to Children**.

5.  If you want to specify a deadline (that is, a time by which these updates should be installed), click the arrow again, and then click **Deadline**. You may specify a standard time (one week, one month, etc.) or a custom time.

6.  Do the same for any other groups for which you would like to approve the selected updates.

7.  When you have finished setting up the approvals, click **Approve**.

8.  You will see the **Approval Progress** window while the updates are being approved. If there is any problem, such as a conflict among the selected updates, it will be reported here. You may click **Cancel** to exit the approval process at any time. When the approval process completes successfully, close the window.
