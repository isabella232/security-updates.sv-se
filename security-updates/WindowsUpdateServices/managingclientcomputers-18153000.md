Managing Client Computers
=========================

WSUS enables you to manage the entire process of updating your computers, including manually and automatically determining which updates they need and receive, specifying when the updates are installed, and monitoring the status of update deployment on your computers.

The central access point in the WSUS console for managing computers is the **Computers** page, which displays a list of computers that have been configured to get updates from the WSUS server. The computers are displayed by computer group, and you can filter the computer list to a specific computer group. By selecting a computer in the list, you can view its properties, which include general details about the computer and the status of updates for it—for example, the installation or detection status of an update for a particular computer.

You can also manage computer groups on the **Computers** page, which includes creating the groups and assigning computers to them. For more information about managing computer groups, see [Managing Computer Groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/14fbb1ef-b9b8-4c9e-a42a-a7237948251a).

| You must first set up a client computer to contact the WSUS server before you can manage it from that server. Until you perform this task, your WSUS server will not recognize your client computer, and will not display it in the computer list on the **Computers** page. For more information about setting up a client computer, see [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777). A client computer can only be set to communicate with one WSUS server at a time. If you later change this setting and specify a different WSUS server, the client computer stops contacting the WSUS server specified earlier. However, the client computer will remain on the list of computers and in the computer groups specified on that earlier WSUS server. In addition, the original WSUS server will report the last time the client computer contacted it (which will be accurate—it will be before the client computer stopped connecting to it). To stop the client computer from displaying on the earlier specified WSUS server, you must remove the computer from the WSUS server. |

Managing Computers on the Computers Page
----------------------------------------

The following are common tasks you can perform on the **Computers** page. Before you can add a computer to a computer group, you create computer groups. For information about creating computer groups, see [Managing Computer Groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/14fbb1ef-b9b8-4c9e-a42a-a7237948251a).

**To view the properties for a computer**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Computers**.

2.  In **Groups**, click the computer group to which the computer currently belongs to.

3.  In the list of computers, click the computer for which you want to view properties.

4.  In the properties pane, do either of the following:

    -   Click the **Details** tab for general information about the computer.
    -   Click the **Status** tab for approval and update status for the computer.

**To add a computer to a computer group**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Computers**.

2.  In **Groups**, click the computer group to which the computer currently belongs.

3.  In the list of computers, click the computer that you want to move.

4.  Under **Tasks**, click **Move selected computer**.

5.  In the **Computer group** dialog box, click the computer group that you want to move the computer to, and then click **OK**.

| If your computer already belongs to a computer group, then after you perform this task it will belong to the new computer group you specify and not to the earlier computer group. However, it will remain a member of the All Computers group. |

**To remove a computer from a WSUS server**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Computers**.

2.  In **Groups**, click the computer group to which the computer currently belongs to.
