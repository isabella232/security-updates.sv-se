Verify Update Deployment
========================

When client computers check in with the WSUS server, you can use the WSUS reporting feature to determine if updates have been deployed. By default, client computers check in with WSUS every 22 hours, but this is configurable. For more information about configuring the time when client computers check in with WSUS, see the "Automatic Update detection frequency" section in [Configure Automatic Updates by Using Group Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/51c8a814-6665-4d50-a0d8-2ae27e69ca7c) later in this guide.

**To check the Status of Updates report**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**.

2.  On the **Reports** page, click **Status of Updates**.

3.  If you want to filter the list of displayed updates, under **View**, select the criteria you want to use, and then click **Apply**.

4.  If you want to see the status of an update by computer group and then by computer, expand the view of the update as necessary.

5.  If you want to print the Status of Updates report, under **Tasks**, click **Print report**.
