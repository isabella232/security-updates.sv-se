Importing Updates to Replica Servers
====================================

In some situations, you may need to import updates or metadata to a replica server. For example, you may wish to speed up the initial synchronization by copying the updates to the replica server. To copy update content to a replica server, you may use the same steps described in [Step 2: Copying Updates from the File System](https://technet.microsoft.com/812d26ba-4b09-4097-9442-430ffc5195ee). However, because metadata is not ordinarily kept on the replica server, you must temporarily turn off the replica setting on the server, import the metadata, and then turn it on again.

Import metadata to a replica server
-----------------------------------

**To import metadata to a replica server**
1.  In the WSUS Administration snap-in, go to **Options**, then select **Update Source and Proxy Server**.

2.  On the **Update Source** tab, clear the **This server is a replica server of the upstream server** check box, and then click **OK** to save the setting.

3.  Follow the procedures for exporting and importing metadata described in [Step 3: Copying Metadata from the Database](https://technet.microsoft.com/e703f564-70fd-4ba3-80cb-bf21c1bb581f).

4.  After completing the import, go back to the **Update Source** tab of the **Update Source and Proxy Server** page, and then select the **This server is a replica server of the upstream server** check box. Click **OK** to save the setting.
