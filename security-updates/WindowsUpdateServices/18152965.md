Approve Updates
===============

You should approve updates to test the functionality of your WSUS deployment. There are many options for deploying updates; the procedure below only covers the basics. Use WSUS Help or the "Microsoft Windows Update Services Operations Guide" to understand all your approval options.

**To approve multiple updates for installation**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Updates**.

2.  On the list of updates, select the multiple updates you want to approve for installation.

3.  Under **Update Tasks**, click **Approve for installation**. The **Approve Updates** dialog box appears with the action for the **Approve** list set to Install for the All Computers group.

4.  If you want to specify a different default approval setting for one or more groups, find the group for which you want to set the special approval setting in the **Group approval settings for the selected updates** box, select an approval setting from the **Approval** column, and then click **OK**. By default, all groups found on the WSUS server are initially set to match the settings for the All Computers group.
