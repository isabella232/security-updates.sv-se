Managing the Client Computers
=============================

The central access point in the WSUS administrative console for managing computers is the **Computers** node. Under this node you can find the different groups you have set up (plus the default group, Unassigned Computers). Selecting one of the computer groups causes the computers in that group to be displayed in the **Details** pane. (If a computer is assigned to multiple groups, it will appear in the listings of both groups.) If you select a computer in the list, you can see its properties, which include general details about the computer and the status of updates for it, such as the installation or detection status of an update for a particular computer. You can filter the list of computers under a given computer group by status. The default shows only computers for which updates are needed or which have had installation failures; however, you can filter the display by any status. Click **Refresh** after changing the status filter.

You can also manage computer groups on the **Computers** page, which includes creating the groups and assigning computers to them. For more information about managing computer groups, see [Managing the Computer Groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/838a2c30-baba-4f07-92e7-2e1b5535643f).

Until you perform this task, your WSUS server will not recognize your client computers and they will not be displayed in the list on the <strong>Computers</strong> page. For more information about setting up client computers, see the WSUS Deployment Guide at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139832">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139832</a>.
