Create Computer Groups for Computers
====================================

There is a description of why you may want to use this feature, as well as a discussion of limitations and default settings, in the "Using Computer Groups" section in [Choose a Type of Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/bc61fb16-13d4-4b3e-b547-fae6a0d5b7bc) earlier in this guide.

Setting up Computer Groups
--------------------------

Setting up computer groups is a three-step process. First, specify how you are going to assign computers to the computer groups. There are two options: *server-side targeting* and *client-side targeting*. Server-side targeting involves manually adding each computer to its group. Client-side targeting involves automatically assigning the computers by using either Group Policy or registry keys. Second, create the computer group in WSUS. Third, move the computers into groups by using whichever method you chose in the first step.

#### Step 1: Specify How to Assign Computers to Computer Groups

Use the WSUS console to specify whether you are using client-side or server-side targeting.

**To specify the method for assigning computers to groups**
1.  In the WSUS console, click **Options**, and then click **Computer Options**.

2.  In the **Computer Options** box, select one of the following options:

    -   **Use the Move computers task in Windows Server Update Services** if you want to create groups and assign computers through the WSUS console.
    -   **Use Group Policy or registry settings on client computers** if you want to create groups and assign computers using Group Policy or by editing registry settings on the client computer.

3.  Under **Tasks**, click **Save settings**, and click **OK** when the confirmation box appears.

#### Step 2: Create Computer Groups

Create the computer groups in WSUS. Whether you use client-side or server-side targeting, you must create the computer groups.

**To create a computer group**
1.  In the WSUS console toolbar, click **Computers**.

2.  Under **Tasks**, click **Create a computer group**.

3.  In the **Group** name box, type a name for your new computer group, and then click **OK**.

#### Step 3: Move the Computers

Use WSUS to move computers into groups or automate this task.

**To move a computer to a different group by using server-side targeting**
1.  In the WSUS console, click **Computers**.

2.  In the **Groups** box, click the computer group of the computer you want to move.

3.  In the list of computers, select the computer you want to move.

4.  Under **Tasks**, click **Move the selected computer**.

5.  In the **Computer group** list, select the computer group you want to move the computer to, and then click **OK**.

**To move a computer to a different group by using client-side targeting**
-   Use Group Policy or registry to enable client-side targeting. For more information about how to configure the client computer, see [Determine a Method to Configure Automatic Updates Clients](https://technet.microsoft.com/8b786951-a481-49a6-a0e6-69189e58f2ab). For more information about the client-side targeting setting, see the "Enable client-side targeting" section in [Configure Automatic Updates by Using Group Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/51c8a814-6665-4d50-a0d8-2ae27e69ca7c), later in this guide.
