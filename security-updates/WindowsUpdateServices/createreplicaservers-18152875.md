Create Replica Servers
======================

A description of the benefits of creating a replica server is available in "Centralized Management" in [Choose a WSUS Management Style](https://technet.microsoft.com/98d5664a-2f6b-4ccf-b440-b71b7d5dec3e) earlier in this guide.

**To create a replica group for centralized management of multiple WSUS servers**
1.  Install WSUS on a computer at a site where it can be managed by an administrator. Follow the steps in [Run WSUS 3.0 Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/0562aa65-72ce-4d86-b1cb-dbee34c51de3) in this guide.

2.  Install WSUS on a computer at a remote site, in the same way as in Step 1. When you have launched the Configuration Wizard, go to the **Choose Upstream Server** page, select the **Synchronize from another Windows Server Update Services server** check box, and then enter the name of the WSUS server from step 1.

3.  If you are planning to use SSL for this connection, select the **Use SSL when synchronizing update information** check box.

4.  Select the **This is a replica of the upstream server** check box.

5.  Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 as necessary to add additional WSUS servers to the replica group.

Enable reporting rollup from replica servers
--------------------------------------------

You can roll up computer and update status from replica servers to their upstream server.

**To enable reporting rollup from replica servers**
1.  In the WSUS administration console on the upstream server, click **Options**, and then **Reporting Rollup**.

2.  Select the **Roll up status from replica downstream servers** check box, and then click **OK**.

| During the client scan, if the server detects the client changed group membership (or name, or IP address, or operating system version), it marks the client as needing a full rollup. The downstream server will roll up these changes to the upstream server during the next rollup after client scan. |
