Access the WSUS 3.0 Administration Console
==========================================

Use the following procedure to access the WSUS administration console.

You must be a member of the local Administrators group or the WSUS Administrators group on the server on which WSUS is installed in order to use all of the features of the WSUS console. However, members of the WSUS Reporters group have read-only access to the console as well. You may also add user accounts to the WSUS Reporters group if the users need to have read-only access to the data.

**To open the WSUS console**
-   On your WSUS server, click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Microsoft Windows Server Update Services**.
